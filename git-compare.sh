# Bash script for running phpcs with our custom moodle rules only on the affected lines from git-diff.
# To install this script - checkout the codechecker project and symlink this script into your path.
# E.g. ln -s <installdir>/git-compare.sh ~/bin/git-cs
# Then run
# > git-cs
# to see the introduced errors since HEAD or
# > git-cs origin/master
# to see the introduced errors since the upstream master (or any valid git-revision).
#
# You can also set this up as a git alias with branch completion.
# Example:
# First create symlink (I call mine git-cs) of this script into PATH (~/bin)
# Add to .gitconfig [alias] section:
#
# cs = !git-cs $1
#
# Now to get branch completion add this to .bashrc:
#
# _git_cs () {
#    _git_branch
# }
#
# Now (in a new shell) type: git cs [TAB][TAB]
# Profit!
