  removing all the previous contents.

Current checkout:

  10.0dev (2fb82334)

Local modifications (only allowed if there is a PR upstream backing it):

  - Added PHPCSAliases.php to base dir to provide phpcs 2/3 compatibility. Needed
    because still there are a number of old class names within the standard. This
    doesn't have any upstream PR, because the file is there, just we had not needed
    it before the jump to phpcs 3.
